# D-SQE
This projects contains a python code allowing one to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript "Dissipative split-charge formalism: Ohm’s law, Nyquist noise, and non-contact friction" by Martin H. Müser.

One of the last three lines of the code should be commented in, so that the program knows whether to run a 'charging', 'nyquist', and 'friction' simulation. 
Parameters can then be set (redefined from default values) in the initialization functions called 'charging', 'nyquist', and 'friction'. 

There is also a gnuplot file movie.gp, which allows a simple visualization, i.e., the visualizations planned to be used for the submission of this manuscript to J. Chem. Phys.
